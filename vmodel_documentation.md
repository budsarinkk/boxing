# VModel Documentation

## Introduction
This document outlines the development process and structure for the Muay Thai Scoreboard Application, following the VModel methodology.

## VModel Overview
The VModel is a software development methodology that emphasizes verification and validation at each stage of the development lifecycle. It is structured as follows:

1. **Requirements Analysis**
2. **System Design**
3. **Architectural Design**
4. **Module Design**
5. **Coding**
6. **Unit Testing**
7. **Integration Testing**
8. **System Testing**
9. **Acceptance Testing**

## Application of VModel to Muay Thai Scoreboard Application

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.
- Identify key stakeholders and their expectations.

### 2. System Design
- Create a high-level design of the application, including data flow diagrams and system architecture.

### 3. Architectural Design
- Define the technical architecture, including the choice of frameworks, libraries, and tools.

### 4. Module Design
- Break down the system into individual modules and define their responsibilities.

### 5. Coding
- Implement the modules as per the design specifications.

### 6. Unit Testing
- Test individual modules to ensure they function as expected.

### 7. Integration Testing
- Test the interaction between modules to ensure seamless integration.

### 8. System Testing
- Test the entire system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.

### 9. Acceptance Testing
- Validate the system with stakeholders to ensure it meets their expectations.

## Development Phases

To ensure a structured approach, the development of the Muay Thai Scoreboard Application will be divided into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering
- Conduct stakeholder meetings to gather requirements.
- Document functional and non-functional requirements.

### Phase 2: Design
- Create system and architectural designs.
- Develop module-level designs.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Code individual modules based on the design specifications.
- Perform unit testing for each module.

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Integrate modules and perform integration testing.
- Conduct system testing to validate the application.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Validation
- Deploy the application in the production environment.
- Perform acceptance testing with stakeholders.

### Phase 6: Maintenance
- Provide ongoing support and updates based on user feedback.

## Conclusion
By following the VModel methodology, the development of the Muay Thai Scoreboard Application will be systematic and ensure high-quality deliverables.
